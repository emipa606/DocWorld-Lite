========
A fork of the ambitious mod Docworld, this mod is more modest, patching a few more than 100 mods and seeks to improve multi mod compatibility. The features are divided in 9 categories:

- New biome foraged food types in caravans.
- Beds require cloth (nullified by specialized bed mods).
- More buildings can be minified, hand selected choices from Vanilla and Mods.
- Glass lights actually requiring glass. Must use the Glass+Lights mod for the glass.
- More linkable furniture support for various linkables where sensible.
- More items can be stuffed.
- Multi Mod Support that improves the compatibility and integration.
- Changes to research prerequisites of some mods
- Some misc changes that defy categorization.
	
Each setting can be disabled in the mod settings menu. Restart required for them to take effect.
